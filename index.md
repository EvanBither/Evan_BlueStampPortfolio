# Security Camera
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

# First Milestone
My first milestone was completing the construction of my main project. I have finished building the security camera and need to plug it into my computer and do the more technical things such as programming it and making sure the camera works. While building the camera, I connected the camera module to the Rasberry Pi controller via a ribbon cable. I assembled the case for the camera, as well as the plastic shielded viewing point that protects the lens and gives the camera a wide enough opening to record. I installed the memory card into the side port of the camera case and made sure that the two micro USB ports and the HDMI port work and can be connected. The challenges I faced were staying organized and figuring out how to assemble the camera. The project came with a lot of extra parts that I didnâ€™t need, and instructions for accessories that did not work with the variation I wanted to build. It was hard to figure out which pieces I needed for the case variation compared to the stand variation for example. My plan to complete the project is to make sure that the electrical components in my camera work, by plugging them in and using the software. After that, I will try videoing with the camera and then think of modifications for my project.

# Starter Project
  My starter project was a digital clock that displays the accurate time, date, and temperature of the room. The clock is powered by a 3-volt battery that allows the internal mechanisms to keep track of the time and date, but the display is powered by a micro-USB cord. The clock sits in a clear box that allows the user to press the two operational buttons that control the display. In order to assemble this project, I needed to solder over 30 components and make sure they were in their correct spots and solder correctly so that there were no electrical shorts. While building my project, it took me many attempts to solder every component correctly and get the clock to work as intended. This project taught me how to solder correctly, and how to de-solder when necessary. I have learned how to stay organized, manage my time efficiently, and when to ask for help.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

<!--# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
